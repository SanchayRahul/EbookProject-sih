PS Title: Application for Assessment of Quality of Textbook/ Reference Books/ E- Book

Description: 
The medical students aiming to be good physicians, need to select a standard medical textbook. It is evident that there are several books made available in ASU (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha) medical systems and every book claims that the book has been written as per CCIM or NCISM syllabus. Amongst some are good and some are of poor quality and were written with vested interest. Due to this, students are trapped by substandard books that leads to poor quality standard among students. Identifying this issue and its impact on medical on the medical system, NCISM constituted an expert committee for the development of an assessment scale for textbooks/ reference books. The expert committee after thorough deliberations developed the assessment scale for the quality assessment of textbooks/ reference books. This assessment scale serves the purpose of:- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Selection of quality textbooks by teachers for their students. Serving as a reference for textbook writers. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Providing criteria to recommend for inclusion in the list of recommended apex/ regulatory bodies. The assessment process requires a review of the books by reviewers (subject-wise reviewers located across the country, 3 reviewers per book) and summarizing the reviewer's remarks and decision by the committee. The development of an application on this will help to get reviews from people around the world online and also will help to summarize all the reviewed data in a faster mode.
